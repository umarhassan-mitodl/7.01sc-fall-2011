This session will review how to make a recombinant cDNA library and how to use this library to find a specific gene. This session will outline the differences between a genomic and a cDNA library, and discuss how to use a cDNA library to clone a gene of interest.

_Learning Objectives_

*   _To understand what a recombinant cDNA library is and how it is constructed._
*   _To understand how to use a cDNA library to identify a gene of interest by the protein made._

##### Question 1
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ1" >}} A recombinant vector in a yeast genomic library may contain more than one gene. This is not the case with the recombinant vectors in a yeast cDNA library because… {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}different restriction enzymes are used.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}every cDNA fragment cloned into each vector carries only one gene.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}the host cells cannot be transformed with a vector carrying more than one gene.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}the vectors used in making a cDNA library are different.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}For a cDNA library, double stranded DNA is made from mRNA. In eukaryotes, each mRNA molecule represents only one gene.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 2
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ2" >}} Unlike a genomic DNA library, particular care must be taken to ensure that the cDNA library represents every gene in the genome. Why is this the case? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}A cDNA library lacks introns.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}Host cells are more likely to reject vectors with cDNA as compared to genomic DNA.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}It is harder to clone cDNA fragments as compared to genomic fragments into the vectors.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}Some genes are transcribed only in certain cell types or at low levels.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}A cDNA library is made from mRNA. A gene that is not actively transcribed in the cells used as a source of mRNA will not produce mRNA, so that gene will not be represented in the library.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 3
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ3" >}} Many cDNA libraries are used as expression libraries. The vector chosen for use in an expression library must have additional DNA sequence that is not required in the vector chosen for use in a genomic DNA library. What is this sequence? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}a promoter specific for the host organism{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}a second selectable marker{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}additional restriction enzyme sites{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}an origin of replication{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution / >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
