description: This session will explain how a collection of mutants with the same phenotype
  can be used to study a biochemical pathway. In effect, this session outlines how
  genetics can be used to study biochemistry. It includes a discussion of yeast as
  a model system. It outlines how to identify mutants with mutations in the same pathway,
  how to characterize the mutants into complementation groups, and how to use epistasis
  tests to infer details about a biochemical pathway.

This session will explain how a collection of mutants with the same phenotype can be used to study a biochemical pathway. In effect, this session outlines how genetics can be used to study biochemistry. It includes a discussion of yeast as a model system. It outlines how to identify mutants with mutations in the same pathway, how to characterize the mutants into complementation groups, and how to use epistasis tests to infer details about a biochemical pathway.

_Learning Objectives_

*   _To be familiar with the life cycle of yeast_.
*   _To understand the difference between a genetic screen and a genetic selection_.
*   _To understand why mutants with mutations in different genes can have the same phenotype_.
*   _To understand what a test of dominance is and why it is performed._
*   _To understand what a test of complementation is and why it is performed_.
*   _To understand what a test of epistasis is and why it is performed._

##### Question 1
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ1" >}} A mutant haploid yeast cell that cannot grow without added histidine (mutant 1) is crossed to a wild-type haploid yeast cell (can grow without added histidine). The resulting diploid yeast cell CANNOT grow without added histidine. Which of the following statements is correct? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}The mutant gene is dominant.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}The mutant gene is recessive.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}The mutant phenotype (cannot grow without added histidine) is dominant.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}The mutant phenotype (cannot grow without added histidine) is recessive.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution >}}The phenotype seen in the heterozygotic diploid is dominant.{{< /quiz_solution >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}
##### Question 2
 {{< quiz_multiple_choice questionId="MCQ2" >}} The phenotypes of two haploid tryptophan auxotrophs (trp1 and trp2) are both found to be recessive. These two mutants are crossed and the resulting diploid CAN grow on minimal media. Which of the following statements is correct? {{< quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}The trp1 and trp2 mutations are in different genes.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="true" >}}The trp1 and trp2 mutations are in the same gene.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< quiz_choice isCorrect="false" >}}The trp1 and trp2 mutations do not complement.{{< /quiz_choice >}} {{< /quiz_choices >}} {{< quiz_solution / >}} {{< /quiz_multiple_choice >}}

Session Activities
